Setting up **ChatGPT Codex with GitHub Pages** is surprisingly straightforward.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- A GitHub Pages‚Äìenabled repository
- [ChatGPT Connector](https://github.com/apps/chatgpt-connector) installed and authorized

---

## üß† Workflow

1. **Install and authorize** the [ChatGPT Connector](https://github.com/apps/chatgpt-connector) for your GitHub account and target repository.
2. In the Codex interface (within ChatGPT), write your blog content in a structured instruction format like this:

   > Create a new Jekyll post from my notes titled  
   > *"Integrating ChatGPT Codex with GitHub Pages"*,  
   > tag it with `chatgpt, ai, github`, and set today‚Äôs date.  
   > Place it in the `_posts` directory.

3. Codex will:
   - Format your post
   - Commit it to a new branch
   - Open a pull request targeting your main branch

4. From there, **you review, approve, and merge** the PR.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Codex cannot merge the pull request itself.**  
  You must do it manually or automate it via GitHub Actions.
- **No built-in preview flow** unless you configure it separately.
- Posts are only deployed once merged to your default GitHub Pages branch (`main` or `gh-pages`).

---

## üîç Ideas to Explore

- `AGENTS.md`: Potentially useful to standardize or document your Codex automation interface
- **Preview workflow**: Deploy PRs to a staging environment before publishing. I would also like to investigate the possibility of previewing through the Codex UI.
- **Auto-merge**: Use GitHub Actions to auto-merge trusted Codex-authored PRs (e.g. labeled `auto-publish`)

---

Overall, this integration brings the power of AI-assisted writing directly into your publishing workflow ‚Äî and with a bit of polish, can be taken even further.
